Library for Medical Imaging in Python

This project is meant to develop and maintain a generic Medical Imaging Library in Python.

I am clueless as to how it will look.

The only thing I'm clear is that I want the library to be clean, simple and externalized. Each module must have a clean API to interact with any other module.

Send pull requests for this file and help me freeze specs or keep watching. 

I'll keep updating this. Gotta make it workable before March.
